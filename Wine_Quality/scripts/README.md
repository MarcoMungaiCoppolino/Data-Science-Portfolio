Like the notebooks/ section, I think this is quite self-explanatory. Scripts, defined as logical units of computation that aren't part of the notebook narratives (you won't call this files as modules), but nonetheless important for, say, getting the data in shape, or stitching together figures generated by individual notebooks.
